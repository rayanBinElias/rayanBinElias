Temp:
Please create Dockerfile including components:
Nginx runs when startup
php-fpm runs when startup
Container port is expected as 8888, and should work with it
Save Nginx’s log and php-fpm’s log on host machine’s dir /usr/local/var/docker/logs with using “mount”
Copy all host machine's files under ./ current dir to absolute path /var/www/workspace/ in a container
